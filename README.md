# NLP Project
this project takes a while to install

first the required librarys must be installed

## Libarys needed
* pytorch
* nltk
* pandas
* skipthoughts (https://github.com/Cadene/skip-thoughts.torch/tree/master/pytorch)
* numpy
* matplotlib

the reqirements.txt file may not work so these librarys may need to be installed manualy via pip

## running the notebooks
when either of the notebooks is first run **jupyter will hang** while the skip thought embedding files are downloaded by the skipthoughts library. these files are rather large so this may take a while. check the progress of these downloads in the terminal.
